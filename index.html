        <h4>The central tenet of Christianity is the belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah (Christ).</h4>
            <p> Christians believe that Jesus, as the Messiah,was anointed by God as savior of humanity and hold that Jesus's coming was the
                 <br>fulfillment of messianic prophecies of the Old Testament.<br>
            </p>
            <hr>

                <br>25 principal forms of Eastern Orthodoxy, numerous varieties of Protestantism,<br>
                 and tiny store-front churches with fewer than 100 members.
